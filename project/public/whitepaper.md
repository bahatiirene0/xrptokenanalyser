# XTA (XRP Token Analyser) — Research Whitepaper

Version 0.1 — This document reflects an ongoing research project. Not investment advice.

## Executive Summary
XTA is a research project exploring AI-assisted due diligence for XRPL-issued assets. Our goal is to prototype transparent, reproducible, and safety-first analysis workflows that help users frame risks and uncertainty. XTA is not a trading product; outputs do not constitute financial advice.

## Motivation
Fragmented on-chain and off-chain information makes it hard to form an informed view about tokens. Many tools overpromise certainty. Our research emphasizes clear uncertainty, reproducibility, and conservative interpretation of noisy signals.

## System Overview
- Data Sources: XRPL core (account_info, account_lines, book_offers, ledger_entry, amm_info); aggregators (xrpl.to, XRPSCAN).
- Pipeline: ingestion, normalization with provenance, short‑TTL caching, and an AI summary layer.
- Outputs: human‑readable bullets with risk context and explicit uncertainty notes.

## Research Principles
- Reproducibility: ground every statement in data.
- Uncertainty Awareness: label missing/low-signal contexts.
- Minimal Assumptions: conservative defaults.
- Ethics: public data only.

## Methodology
- Issuer risk: flags (master key, global freeze, fees), domain/regular key context.
- Liquidity: orderbook spread/density; AMM reserves/fees/vote slots.
- Holder concentration: top percentiles; proxy holders when sparse.
- Sparkline: trend sketching; avoid overclaiming.
- AI Layer: prompt constrained to provided JSON; cautious language; uncertainty explicit.

## Tokenomics (illustrative, research‑phase)
- Total Supply: 1,000,000
- Team: 5%
- LP burned: 100%
- Taxes: 0%
- Marketing & Partnerships: 5%
- Utilities: AI analysis access, developer API, governance for research roadmap.

## Roadmap
- Q1–Q2 2024: core ingestion/UI/AI summaries (completed)
- Q3 2024: predictive prototypes, beta, community testing (in progress)
- Q4 2024: token generation, marketing/shilling, public launch, integrations
- 2025: multi‑chain, advanced models, mobile, institutional features

## Limitations & Disclaimers
Data gaps and thin liquidity reduce confidence. AI summaries can misinterpret low-signal contexts; always validate with raw data. Markets move; snapshots lag. XTA is research, provided as‑is, not investment advice.

## Future Work
Per‑bullet confidence scoring, richer provenance (source/timestamps), and community‑curated metadata standards for XRPL tokens.
